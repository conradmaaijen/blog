Better deletion of files with Trash

Ever got to the point when you did a `rm delete-me.txt` and then realized you made a mistake by deleting this file. Luckily we have a Recycle bin right? Well we have, but the `delete-me.txt` file is not in it obviously, `rm` completely removes the file from your computer.

Better would be installing `Trash` on your machine. Trash moves you file to the Recycle bin like it does when you remove a file using the Finder on a Mac. So let install [Trash](https://github.com/sindresorhus/trash).

## Trash

	$ npm install --global trash-cli

Now you can use the trash command in you terminal.

	$ trash delete-me.txt

Or move a complete folder to the Recycle bin:

	$ trash foldername

Iâ€™m sure you feel a lot more secure now when you are deleting files or folders from your machine using the terminal.
